I am a PhD student in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://scis.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://smu.edu.sg/), where I am part of the [System Analysis and Verification](https://sav-smu.github.io/) (SAV) group. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sun Jun](http://sunjun.site/)

My research aims to bridge the gap between theories and applications by conducting impactful and practical research projects. In detail, I want to improve the quality of the codebase by developing theories, methods, tools to automatically discover and patch vulnerabilities. I am interested in: smart contract security, symbolic execution, fuzzing
